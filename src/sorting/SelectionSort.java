/**
 * The list is divided into two parts - sorted part at the left end and  unsorted part at the right end.
 * Initially, the sorted part is empty and the unsorted part is the entire list.
 * The smallest element is selected from the unsorted array and swapped with the leftmost element, becomes a part of the sorted array.
 * This process continues moving unsorted array boundary by one element to the right.
 * Not suitable for large data sets - average and worst case complexities are of ÎŸ(n^2).
