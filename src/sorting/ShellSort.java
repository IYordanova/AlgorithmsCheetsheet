/**
 * Based on insertion sort algorithm with optimization to avoid large shifts.
 * Insertion sort is used on widely spread elements, first to sort them and then sort the less widely spaced elements.
 * This spacing is termed as interval, it's calculated based on Knuth's formula as  h = h * 3 + 1, where h's initial value is 1
 * Efficient for medium-sized data sets - average and worst-case complexity depend on the gap sequence the best ÎŸ(n)
